# Sequential Decison Making Problems (SDMPs)
============================================

Code for experiments based on work in the following papers:
    1. Fu, Haobo, et al. "What are dynamic optimization problems?." Evolutionary Computation (CEC), 2014 IEEE Congress on. IEEE, 2014.
    2. Fu, Haobo, Peter R. Lewis, and Xin Yao. "A Q-learning Based Evolutionary Algorithm for Sequential Decision Making Problems."
    
Q-Learning is an implementation of Q Learning from Watkins, Christopher John Cornish Hellaby. 
Learning from delayed rewards. Diss. University of Cambridge, 1989.
